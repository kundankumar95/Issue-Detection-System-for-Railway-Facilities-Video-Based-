Project Title
Issue Detection System for Railway Facilities (Video-Based)

Description
This project involves a system that analyzes video footage to detect and classify issues related to electricity, water, and security in railway facilities. The system processes each frame of the video to identify and classify issues, providing real-time feedback on detected problems.

Features
Video Upload: Allows users to upload video files for analysis.
Frame Extraction: Processes individual frames from the video to detect issues.
Issue Detection: Automatically classifies each frame into one of the following categories:
Electricity Issue: Identifies problems related to electrical components.
Water Issue: Detects water-related issues, such as leaks or floods.
Security Issue: Flags potential security problems or breaches.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides feedback on detected issues for each frame of the video.
Summary Report: Generates a summary of detected issues throughout the video.
Technologies Used
Python: For backend processing and video analysis.
TensorFlow: For machine learning model implementation.
OpenCV: For video processing and frame extraction.
